# JSON GUI Streamlit

This is a Streamlit version of the **JSON Bulk Editor**.

Run the app with:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Select a directory containing JSON files with the same structure. You can remove null/zero values, remove keys with null/zero values, delete a specific key in all files, and save the modified JSON files.

A log of deletions can be saved to `deletion_log.txt` in the same directory.
